##Description
Better local estimates of diabetes and obesity prevalence might influence public health efforts in various ways. 
First, awareness of the size and scope of the problems is important for local policy makers to identify the necessary 
community and clinical services to prevent and control the conditions. For example, lifestyle programs for diabetes prevention and 
community support groups for diabetes self-management have been shown effective when they are linked to a referring clinical center. 
Second, population-targeted interventions (e.g., changes in health-care access, preventive care, food taxation, or food labeling) 
might affect specific areas, populations segments, or high-risk populations in ways that are not detectable via broad, 
population-based surveys. More sensitive local area surveillance can provide a better means of tracking such effects.(from MMWR Estimated County-Level Prevalence of Diabetes and Obesity --- United States, 2007)
